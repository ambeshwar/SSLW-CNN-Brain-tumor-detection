# SSLW-CNN-Brain-Tumor-Detection
The SSLW-CNN method comprises three steps: preprocessing, feature learning, and classification. A subtractive probable pixel normalization model is applied to diminish the noisy image. A CNN model with spatial lightweight is used to generate high-level features with minimal computational complexity.
